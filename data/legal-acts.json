Here\nA is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend\nZ, and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that “nothing is\nan offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it”.\n(2) Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part\nof this Sanhita in conformity with the explanation.\n(3) When property is in the possession of a person’s spouse, clerk or servant, on\naccount of that person, it is in that person’s possession within the meaning of this Sanhita.\nExplanation.—A person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity\nof a clerk or servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub-section.\n(4) In every Part of this Sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the\ncontext, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.\n(5) When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common\nintention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done\nby him alone.\n(6) Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal\nknowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the\nact with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were\ndone by him alone with that knowledge or intention.\n(7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an\nact or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect\npartly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.\nIllustration.\nAintentionally causes Z’s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly\nby beating Z.

Here A and B\nintentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by\nwhich the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively\nfor six hours at a time.Aand B, intending to cause Z’s death, knowingly cooperate in causing\nthat effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food\nsupplied to them for that purpose.

B, without collusion or cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food,\nknowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z’s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder,\nbut, as A did not cooperate with B.A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.\n(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal\nact, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.\nIllustration.\nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would\nbe only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending\nto kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here,\nthoughA and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and Ais guilty\nonly of culpable homicide.\n",

(1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the\npossession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to\nsuch taking, is said to commit theft.\nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable\nproperty, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as\nsoon as it is severed from the earth.\nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may\nbe a theft.\nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle\nwhich prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by\nactually moving it.\nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to\nmove that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused,\nis moved by that animal.\nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in this section may be express or implied,\nand may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that\npurpose authority either express or implied.\nIllustrations.\n(a)A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree\nout of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order\nto such taking, he has committed theft.\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if\nA’s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A\nhas committed theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain\ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins\nto move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n(d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs\naway with the plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate toA, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall\nreturn.Acarries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession.\nIt could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though\nhe may have committed criminal breach of trust.\n(f)Afinds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring\nis in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by\ntaking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to\nmisappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a\nplace where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking\nthe ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of\nfirst moving the ring, commits theft.\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not\nowing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a\nsecurity, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away.\nHere A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed\ntheft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n(j) IfAowes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as\na security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of\ndepriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes\nit dishonestly.\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without\nZ’s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the\nwatch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with\nthe intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here\nA takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes\naway a book without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the\nintention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s\nimplied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n(n)Aasks charity from Z’s wife. She givesAmoney, food and clothes, whichAknows\nto belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable thatAmay conceive that Z’s wife is authorised\nto give away alms. If this was A’s impression, Ahas not committed theft.\n(o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to\nbelong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If\nA takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes\nthat property out of Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not\ncommit theft.\n(2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description\nfor a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second\nor subsequent conviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with\nrigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend\nto five years and with fine:\nProvided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five\nthousand rupees, and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value\nof property or restoration of the stolen property, shall be punished with community service.\nSec.\n",

A, in order to defraud\nB, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by\nB that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b)A, without Z’s authority, affixes Z’s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance\nof an estate from Z toA, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining\nfrom B the purchase-money. Ahas committed forgery.\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any\nsum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the\nsum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.\n(d)Aleaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed byA, without inserting the\nsum payable and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten\nthousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the\ncheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority,\nintending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its\nmaturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to\nsuppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f) Z’s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally\ndivided between A, B and C”.A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be\nbelieved that the whole was left to himself and C.A has committed forgery.\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order\nby writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B\ndishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special\nendorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.\n(h)Asells and conveys an estate to Z.Aafterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate,\nexecutes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the\nconveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he\nconveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the\nlegatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his\ninstructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.\n(j)Awrites a letter and signs it with B’s name without B’s authority, certifying thatA is\na man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune,\nintending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as Amade\na false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.\n(k) A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certifying to A’s\ncharacter, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as\nmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter\ninto an express or implied contract for service.\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that\nthe bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in\norder that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and\nnegotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B,\nknowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of\nforgery.\n(c)Apicks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same\nname. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was\nendorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the\nseizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent\nand for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to\ndefraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B,\nthough he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.\n(e)A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit, and\nwith intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a\npromissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the\nnote, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of\ninsolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.\nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person,\nintending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a\ndeceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in\nhis lifetime, may amount to forgery.\nIllustration.\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in\nthe name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.\nExplanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic\nsignature” shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2\nof the Information TechnologyAct, 2000.\n",
