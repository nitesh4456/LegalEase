subject to the exceptions contained in the Chapter entitled  General Exceptions , though
those exceptions are not repeated in such definition, penal provision, or Illustration.
Illustrations.
(a) The sections in this Sanhita, which contain definitions of offences, do not express
that a child under seven years of age cannot commit such offences; but the definitions are to
be understood subject to the general exception which provides that nothing shall be an
offence which is done by a child under seven years of age.
(b)A, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends Z, who has committed murder. Here
A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend
Z, and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that  nothing is
an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it .
(2) Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part
of this Sanhita in conformity with the explanation.
(3) When property is in the possession of a person s spouse, clerk or servant, on

context, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.
(5) When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common
intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done

knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the

(7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an
act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect
partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.
Illustration.
Aintentionally causes Z s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly
by beating Z. A has committed murder.
(8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally
cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or
jointly with any other person, commits that offence.
Illustrations.
(a)Aand B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses
of poison.Aand B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z.
Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B
intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by
which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.
(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively
for six hours at a time.Aand B, intending to cause Z s death, knowingly cooperate in causing
that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food

of Z.
(c)A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner.A, intending to cause Z s death, illegally
omits to supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the
starvation is not sufficient to cause his death.A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds
him. B, without collusion or cooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food,
knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder,
but, as A did not cooperate with B.A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.
(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal
act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.
Illustration.
A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would
be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending
to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here,
thoughA and B are both engaged in causing Z s death, B is guilty of murder, and Ais guilty
only of culpable homicide.

term, in which imprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may
have been sentenced or to which he may be liable under a commutation of a sentence.

six years after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be liable

of that period; and the death of the offender does not discharge from the liability any
property which would, after his death, be legally liable for his debts.
9. (1) Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is
itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more than one of
such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.
(2) Where 
(a) anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any
law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished; or
(b) several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves
constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence,
the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries
him could award for any one of such offences.
Illustrations.
(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of
voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which
make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be
imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the
whole beating.
(b) But, if, whileAis beating Z, Y interferes, andAintentionally strikesY, here, as the

punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given to Y.
10. In all cases in which judgment is given that a person is guilty of one of several
offences specified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is

subsequent offence to imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to ten years.
14. Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a
mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be,
bound by law to do it.
Illustrations.
(a)A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity with the
commands of the law. Ahas committed no offence.

notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such judgment or order,
provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court had such jurisdiction.
17. Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who
by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes
himself to be justified by law, in doing it.
Illustration.
Asees Z commit what appears toAto be a murder.A, in the exercise, to the best of his
judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending
murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has
committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence.
18. Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, and without any
criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful
means and with proper care and caution.
Illustration.
Ais at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here,
if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an
offence.
19. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that
it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in
good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.
Explanation. It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented
or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the
act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.
Illustrations.
(a) A, the captain of a vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his
part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably
run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course
of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C
with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, ifAalters his course
without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding
the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run
down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found
as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in
incurring the risk of running down the boat C.
(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from
spreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property.
Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to
excuse A s act, A is not guilty of the offence.
20. Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age.
21. Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under
twelve years of age, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of
the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion.
22. Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by
reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is
doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.
23. Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by
reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is
either wrong, or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.
24. In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge
or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with
as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless
the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against
his will.
25. Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not
known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any
harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen
years of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by
reason of any harm which it may be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such
person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration.
A and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the
consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused
without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z,Acommits no offence.
26. Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm
which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely
to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a
consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.
Illustration.
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who
suffers under the painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z s death, and intending, in
good faith, Z s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z s consent. Ahas committed no
offence.
27. Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years
of age, or person of unsound mind, by, or by consent, either express or implied, of the
guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any
harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be
likely to cause to that person:
Provided that this exception shall not extend to  
(a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause
death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the
curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous
hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of
any grievous disease or infirmity;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not
extend.
Illustration.
A, in good faith, for his child s benefit without his child s consent, has his child cut for
the stone by a surgeon knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the child s death,
but not intending to cause the child s death. A is within the exception, in as much as his
object was the cure of the child.
28. A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Sanhita,  
(a) if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception
of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the
consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or
(b) if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or
intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he
gives his consent; or
(c) unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a
person who is under twelve years of age.
29. The exceptions in sections 25, 26 and 27 do not extend to acts which are offences
independently of any harm which they may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to
be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given.
Illustration.
Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the
woman) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to
the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence  by reason of such harm ; and the consent of the
woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act.
30. Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for
whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person s consent, if the circumstances
are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable
of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it
is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit:
Provided that this exception shall not extend to  
(a) the intentional causing of death, or the attempting to cause death;
(b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause
death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the
curing of any grievous disease or infirmity;
(c) the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, for any
purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt;
(d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not
extend.
Illustrations.
(1) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible.A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to
be trepanned. A, not intending Z s death, but in good faith, for Z s benefit, performs the
trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no offence.
(2) Z is carried off by a tiger.Afires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may
kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, and in good faith intending Z s benefit.A s bullet gives Z a
mortal wound.A has committed no offence.
(3)A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an
operation be immediately performed. There is no time to apply to the child s guardian. A
performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good faith, the
child s benefit. A has committed no offence.
(4) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket.A
drops the child from the house top, knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but
not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child s benefit. Here, even if
the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence.
Explanation. Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of
sections 26, 27 and this section.
31. No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the
person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.
Illustration.
A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live.
The patient dies in consequence of the shock.A has committed no offence, though he knew
it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient s death.
32. Except murder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an
offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of
doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise
be the consequence:
Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable
apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by
which he became subject to such constraint.
Explanation 1. A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being
beaten, joins a gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this
exception, on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that
is an offence by law.
Explanation 2. A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant
death, to do a thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his
tools and to force the door of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the
benefit of this exception.
33. Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or
that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.
34. Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
35. Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 37, to
defend 
(a) his own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting
the human body;
(b) the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other
person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery,
mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief
or criminal trespass.
36. When an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by
reason of the youth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the
intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the part of
that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act which he
would have if the act were that offence.
Illustrations.
(a) Z, a person of unsound mind, attempts to killA; Z is guilty of no offence. ButAhas
the same right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.
(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith,
taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception,
commits no offence. ButA has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would
have if Z were not acting under that misconception.
37. (1) There is no right of private defence,  
(a) against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death
or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good
faith under colour of his office, though that act, may not be strictly justifiable by law;
(b) against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death
or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public
servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not
be strictly justifiable by law;
(c) in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public
authorities.
(2) The right of private defence in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than
it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.
Explanation 1. A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act
done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason
to believe, that the person doing the act is such public servant.
Explanation 2. A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act
done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has
reason to believe, that the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such
person states the authority under which he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he
produces such authority, if demanded.
38. The right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions specified in
section 37, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the
offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter
enumerated, namely: 
(a) such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will
otherwise be the consequence of such assault;
(b) such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous
hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;
(c) an assault with the intention of committing rape;
(d) an assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust;
(e) an assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting;
(f) an assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under
circumstances which may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to
have recourse to the public authorities for his release;
(g) an act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer
acid which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise
be the consequence of such act.
39. If the offence be not of any of the descriptions specified in section 38, the right of
private defence of the body does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the
assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions specified in section 37, to the voluntary
causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.
40. The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable
apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence
though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as such
apprehension of danger to the body continues.
41. The right of private defence of property extends, under the restrictions specified in
section 37, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the
offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise
of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely: 
(a) robbery;
(b) house-breaking after sunset and before sunrise;
(c) mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any building, tent
or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or as a place for
the custody of property;
(d) theft, mischief, or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may
reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence,
if such right of private defence is not exercised.
42. If the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which occasions
the exercise of the right of private defence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any
of the descriptions specified in section 41, that right does not extend to the voluntary
causing of death, but does extend, subject to the restrictions specified in section 37, to the
voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than death.
43. The right of private defence of property,  
(a) commences when a reasonable apprehension of danger to the property
commences;
(b) against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat with the
property or either the assistance of the public authorities is obtained, or the property
has been recovered;
(c) against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or attempts to
cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant
death or of instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues;
(d) against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the offender
continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief;
(e) against house-breaking after sunset and before sunrise continues as long as
the house-trespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues.
44. If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably
causes the apprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually
exercise that right without risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence
extends to the running of that risk.
Illustration.
A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his
right of private defence without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming
young children who are mingled with the mob.Acommits no offence if by so firing he harms
any of the children.
45. A person abets the doing of a thing, who 
(a) instigates any person to do that thing; or
(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the
doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that
conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or
(c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1. A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment
of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts
to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.
Illustration.
A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court to apprehend Z. B, knowing
that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents toAthat C is Z, and thereby intentionally
causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.
Explanation 2. Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act,
does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the
commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
46. A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the
commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of
committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.
Explanation 1. The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an
offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.
Explanation 2. To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act
abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be
caused.
Illustrations.
(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit
murder.
(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers
from the wound.Ais guilty of instigating B to commit murder.
Explanation 3. It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law
of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as
that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.
Illustrations.
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an
act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an
offence, and having the same intention asA. HereA, whether the act be committed or not, is
guilty of abetting an offence.
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age,
to do an act which causes Z s death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the
absence of A and thereby causes Z s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of
committing an offence, Ais liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable
by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to
the punishment of death.
(c)Ainstigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness
of mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong
or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence ofA s instigation. B has committed
no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is
liable to the punishment provided for that offence.
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging
to Z out of Z s possession. Ainduces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the
property out of Z s possession, in good faith, believing it to beA s property. B, acting under
this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is
guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.
Explanation 4. The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such
an abetment is also an offence.
Illustration.
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and
C commits that offence in consequence of B s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his
offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is
also liable to the same punishment.
Explanation 5. It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by
conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is
sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.
Illustration.
Aconcerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed thatAshall administer the poison.
B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but
without mentioningA s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to
B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained.Aadministers the poison; Z dies
in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged
in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the
offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.
47. A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Sanhita who, in India, abets
the commission of any act without and beyond India which would constitute an offence if
committed in India.
Illustration.
A, in India, instigates B, a foreigner in country X, to commit a murder in that country,
A is guilty of abetting murder.
48. A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Sanhita who, without and
beyond India, abets the commission of any act in India which would constitute an offence if
committed in India.
Illustration.
A, in country X, instigates B, to commit a murder in India,Ais guilty of abetting murder.
49. Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of
the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Sanhita for the punishment of such
abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
Explanation. An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment,
when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or
with the aid which constitutes the abetment.
Illustrations.
(a) Ainstigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits
that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.
(b) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the
poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the
conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A s absence and thereby causes Z s death. Here
B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the
punishment for murder.
50. Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the
act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the
punishment provided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had been
done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other.
51. When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act
done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had directly abetted it:
Provided that the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was
committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the
conspiracy which constituted the abetment.
Illustrations.
(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that
purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the
food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence
of A s instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of
the abetment,Ais liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had instigated the
child to put the poison into the food of Y.
(b) A instigates B to burn Z s house, B sets fire to the house and at the same time
commits theft of property there.A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not
guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence
of the burning.
(c)Ainstigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of
robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and
being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable
consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder.
52. If the act for which the abettor is liable under section 51 is committed in addition to
the act abetted, and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each
of the offences.
Illustration.
A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence,
resists that distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the
officer executing the distress.As B has committed both the offence of resisting the distress,
and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these
offences; and, ifA knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the
distress, A will also be liable to punishment for each of the offences.
53. When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a
particular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment,
causes a different effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect
caused, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had abetted the act with the
intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act abetted was likely to cause
that effect.
Illustration.
A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation,
causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt
abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided
for murder.
54. Whenever any person, who is absent would be liable to be punished as an abettor,
is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in consequence of the
abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence.
55. Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life, shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment,
and no express provision is made under this Sanhita for the punishment of such abetment, be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven
years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if any act for which the abettor is liable in consequence
of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall
also be liable to fine.
Illustration.
A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he
would have been subject to the punishment of death or imprisonment for life.Therefore, Ais
liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to a fine; and if
any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for
a term which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine.
56. Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be
not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made under this
Sanhita for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any
description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the
longest term provided for that offence; or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or
with both; and if the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to
prevent the commission of such offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of
any description provided for that offence, for a term which may extend to one-half of the
longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or
with both.
Illustrations.
(a)Ainstigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence,Ahas
nevertheless committed the offence defined in this section, and is punishable accordingly.
(b) A, a police officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of
robbery. Here, though the robbery be not committed, A is liable to one-half of the longest
term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine.
(c) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police officer, whose duty it is to
prevent that offence. Here, though the robbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the
longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also to fine.
57. Whoever abets the commission of an offence by the public generally or by any
number or class of persons exceeding ten, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years and with fine.
Illustration.
A affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten
members to meet at a certain time and place, for the purpose of attacking the members of an
adverse sect, while engaged in a procession. A has committed the offence defined in this
section.
58. Whoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby
facilitate the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life,
voluntarily conceals by any act or omission, or by the use of encryption or any other
information hiding tool, the existence of a design to commit such offence or makes any
representation which he knows to be false respecting such design shall,  
(a) if that offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years; or
(b) if the offence be not committed, with imprisonment of either description, for
a term which may extend to three years,
and shall also be liable to fine.
Illustration.
A, knowing that dacoity is about to be committed at B, falsely informs the Magistrate
that a dacoity is about to be committed at C, a place in an opposite direction, and thereby
misleads the Magistrate with intent to facilitate the commission of the offence. The dacoity
is committed at B in pursuance of the design. A is punishable under this section.
59. Whoever, being a public servant, intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely
that he will thereby facilitate the commission of an offence which it is his duty as such public
servant to prevent, voluntarily conceals, by any act or omission or by the use of encryption
or any other information hiding tool, the existence of a design to commit such offence, or
makes any representation which he knows to be false respecting such design shall,  
(a) if the offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment of any description
provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term of
such imprisonment, or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both; or
(b) if the offence be punishable with death or imprisonment for life, with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years; or
(c) if the offence be not committed, shall be punished with imprisonment of any
description provided for the offence for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of
the longest term of such imprisonment or with such fine as is provided for the offence,
or with both.
Illustration.
A, an officer of police, being legally bound to give information of all designs to commit
robbery which may come to his knowledge, and knowing that B designs to commit robbery,
omits to give such information, with intent to so facilitate the commission of that offence.
Here A has by an illegal omission concealed the existence of B s design, and is liable to
punishment according to the provision of this section.
60. Whoever, intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby
facilitate the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment, voluntarily conceals,
by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a design to commit such offence, or makes any
representation which he knows to be false respecting such design shall,  
(a) if the offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment of the description
provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one-fourth; and
(b) if the offence be not committed, to one-eighth,
of the longest term of such imprisonment, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or
with both.
61. (1) When two or more persons agree with the common object to do, or cause to be
done  
(a) an illegal act; or
(b) an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is designated
a criminal conspiracy:
Provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to
a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties
to such agreement in pursuance thereof.
Explanation. It is immaterial whether the illegal act is the ultimate object of such

Illustrations.
(a)Alays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with
the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm,
treads on it, falls in and is killed.A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.
(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or
knowing it to be likely to cause Z s death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z.
Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.
(c)A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush;
A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not
guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act
that he knew was likely to cause death.

bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper
remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.
Explanation 3. The causing of the death of a child in the mother s womb is not
homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any
part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been
completely born.
101. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder,  
(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
death; or
(b) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person
to whom the harm is caused; or
(c) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient
in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or
(d) if the person committing the act by which the death is caused, knows that it
is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily
injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring
the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.
Illustrations.
(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits
murder.
(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause
his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of
the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the
ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A,
not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the
ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may
intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or
such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.

(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one
of them.Ais guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any
particular individual.
Exception 1. Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the
power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who
gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident:
Provided that the provocation is not,  
(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or
doing harm to any person;
(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the
lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;
(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.
Explanation. Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent
the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.
Murder.
Illustrations.
(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally
killsY, Z s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and
the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the
provocation.
(b)Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A.A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at
Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight.
Akills Z. HereAhas not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.
(c)A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. Ais excited to sudden and violent passion by
the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing
done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.
(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a
word of A s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by
these words, and kills Z. This is murder.
(e) A attempts to pull Z s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays
hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in
consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing
done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage.A, a bystander, intending
to take advantage of B s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B s hand for that
purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, butA
is guilty of murder.
Exception 2. Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good
faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by
law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence
without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for
the purpose of such defence.
Illustration.
Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A
draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other
means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed
murder, but only culpable homicide.
Exception 3. Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant
or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers
given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be
lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without
ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.
Exception 4. Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation
in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender s
having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
Explanation. It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or
commits the first assault.
Exception 5. Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused,
being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own
consent.
Illustration.
A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of
Z s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted
murder.

intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance
to Z, A has used criminal force to Z.

is within, any place, any person residing in, or being in charge of, such place shall, on
demand of such person acting as aforesaid or such police officer, allow him free ingress
thereto, and afford all reasonable facilities for a search therein.
(2) If ingress to such place cannot be obtained under sub-section (1), it shall be lawful
in any case for a person acting under a warrant and in any case in which a warrant may
issue, but cannot be obtained without affording the person to be arrested an opportunity of
escape, for a police officer to enter such place and search therein, and in order to effect an
entrance into such place, to break open any outer or inner door or window of any house or
place, whether that of the person to be arrested or of any other person, if after notification
of his authority and purpose, and demand of admittance duly made, he cannot otherwise
obtain admittance:
Provided that if any such place is an apartment in the actual occupancy of a female
(not being the person to be arrested) who, according to custom, does not appear in public,
such person or police officer shall, before entering such apartment, give notice to such

(i) a person is arrested by a police officer under a warrant which does not
provide for the taking of bail, or under a warrant which provides for the taking of bail
but the person arrested cannot furnish bail; and

produce the person arrested.
51. (1) When a person is arrested on a charge of committing an offence of such a
nature and alleged to have been committed under such circumstances that there are
reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of his person will afford evidence as
to the commission of an offence, it shall be lawful for a registered medical practitioner,
acting at the request of any police officer, and for any person acting in good faith in his aid
and under his direction, to make such an examination of the person arrested as is reasonably
necessary in order to ascertain the facts which may afford such evidence, and to use such

authority and in the absence of such a practitioner within the radius of sixteen kilometres
from the place where the offence has been committed, by any other registered medical

person shall prepare the record of such examination, mentioning therein any injuries or
marks of violence upon the person arrested, and the approximate time when such injuries or
marks may have been inflicted.

examination shall be furnished by the medical officer or registered medical practitioner, as
the case may be, to the arrested person or the person nominated by such arrested person.

identification by any other person or persons is considered necessary for the purpose of
investigation of such offence, the Court, having jurisdiction may, on the request of the
officer in charge of a police station, direct the person so arrested to subject himself to
identification by any person or persons in such manner as the Court may deem fit:
Provided that if the person identifying the person arrested is mentally or physically
disabled, such process of identification shall take place under the supervision of a Magistrate
who shall take appropriate steps to ensure that such person identifies the person arrested

the serving officer, sign a receipt therefor on the back of the other duplicate.
65. (1) Service of a summons on a company or corporation may be effected by serving
it on the Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer of the company or corporation, or by
letter sent by registered post addressed to the Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer
of the company or corporation in India, in which case the service shall be deemed to have
been effected when the letter would arrive in ordinary course of post.

member of his family residing with him, and the person with whom the summons is so left
shall, if so required by the serving officer, sign a receipt therefor on the back of the other
duplicate.
Explanation. A servant is not a member of the family within the meaning of this

section 64, section 65 or section 66, the serving officer shall affix one of the duplicates of the
summons to some conspicuous part of the house or homestead in which the person
summoned ordinarily resides; and thereupon the Court, after making such inquiries as it
thinks fit, may either declare that the summons has been duly served or order fresh service
in such manner as it considers proper.
68. (1) Where the person summoned is in the active service of the Government, the
Court issuing the summons shall ordinarily send it in duplicate to the head of the office in
which such person is employed; and such head shall thereupon cause the summons to be
served in the manner provided by section 64, and shall return it to the Court under his
signature with the endorsement required by that section.
(2) Such signature shall be evidence of due service.
69. When a Court desires that a summons issued by it shall be served at any place
outside its local jurisdiction, it shall ordinarily send such summons in duplicate to a
Magistrate within whose local jurisdiction the person summoned resides, or is, to be there
served.
70. (1) When a summons issued by a Court is served outside its local jurisdiction, and
in any case where the officer who has served a summons is not present at the hearing of the
case, an affidavit, purporting to be made before a Magistrate, that such summons has been
served, and a duplicate of the summons purporting to be endorsed (in the manner provided
by section 64 or section 66) by the person to whom it was delivered or tendered or with
whom it was left, shall be admissible in evidence, and the statements made therein shall be
deemed to be correct unless and until the contrary is proved.

a Court issuing a summons to a witness may, in addition to and simultaneously with the
issue of such summons, direct a copy of the summons to be served by electronic
communication or by registered post addressed to the witness at the place where he ordinarily
resides or carries on business or personally works for gain.
(2) When an acknowledgement purporting to be signed by the witness or an
endorsement purporting to be made by a postal employee that the witness refused to take
delivery of the summons has been received or on the proof of delivery of summons under
sub-section (3) of section 70 by electronic communication to the satisfaction of the Court,
the Court issuing summons may deem that the summons has been duly served.

direct by endorsement on the warrant that, if such person executes a bail bond with sufficient
sureties for his attendance before the Court at a specified time and thereafter until otherwise
directed by the Court, the officer to whom the warrant is directed shall take such security
and shall release such person from custody.
(2) The endorsement shall state 
(a) the number of sureties;
(b) the amount in which they and the person for whose arrest the warrant is
issued, are to be respectively bound;
(c) the time at which he is to attend before the Court.
(3) Whenever security is taken under this section, the officer to whom the warrant is
directed shall forward the bond to the Court.
74. (1) A warrant of arrest shall ordinarily be directed to one or more police officers;
but the Court issuing such a warrant may, if its immediate execution is necessary and no
police officer is immediately available, direct it to any other person or persons, and such
person or persons shall execute the same.
(2) When a warrant is directed to more officers or persons than one, it may be executed
by all, or by any one or more of them.
75. (1) The Chief Judicial Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class may direct a
warrant to any person within his local jurisdiction for the arrest of any escaped convict,
proclaimed offender or of any person who is accused of a non-bailable offence and is
evading arrest.
(2) Such person shall acknowledge in writing the receipt of the warrant, and shall
execute it if the person for whose arrest it was issued, is in, or enters on, any land or other
property under his charge.
(3) When the person against whom such warrant is issued is arrested, he shall be
made over with the warrant to the nearest police officer, who shall cause him to be taken
before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, unless security is taken under section 73.
76. A warrant directed to any police officer may also be executed by any other police
officer whose name is endorsed upon the warrant by the officer to whom it is directed or
endorsed.
77. The police officer or other person executing a warrant of arrest shall notify the
substance thereof to the person to be arrested, and, if so required, shall show him the
warrant.
78. The police officer or other person executing a warrant of arrest shall (subject to
the provisions of section 73 as to security) without unnecessary delay bring the person
arrested before the Court before which he is required by law to produce such person:
Provided that such delay shall not, in any case, exceed twenty-four hours exclusive
of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate's Court.
79. A warrant of arrest may be executed at any place in India.
80. (1) When a warrant is to be executed outside the local jurisdiction of the Court
issuing it, such Court may, instead of directing the warrant to a police officer within its
jurisdiction, forward it by post or otherwise to any Executive Magistrate or District
Superintendent of Police or Commissioner of Police within the local limits of whose jurisdiction
it is to be executed; and the Executive Magistrate or District Superintendent or Commissioner
shall endorse his name thereon, and if practicable, cause it to be executed in the manner
hereinbefore provided.
(2) The Court issuing a warrant under sub-section (1) shall forward, along with the
warrant, the substance of the information against the person to be arrested together with
such documents, if any, as may be sufficient to enable the Court acting under section 83 to
decide whether bail should or should not be granted to the person.
81. (1) When a warrant directed to a police officer is to be executed beyond the local
jurisdiction of the Court issuing the same, he shall ordinarily take it for endorsement either
to an Executive Magistrate or to a police officer not below the rank of an officer in charge of
a police station, within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the warrant is to be executed.
(2) Such Magistrate or police officer shall endorse his name thereon and such
endorsement shall be sufficient authority to the police officer to whom the warrant is
directed to execute the same, and the local police shall, if so required, assist such officer in
executing such warrant.
(3) Whenever there is reason to believe that the delay occasioned by obtaining the
endorsement of the Magistrate or police officer within whose local jurisdiction the warrant
is to be executed will prevent such execution, the police officer to whom it is directed may
execute the same without such endorsement in any place beyond the local jurisdiction of
the Court which issued it.
82. (1) When a warrant of arrest is executed outside the district in which it was issued,
the person arrested shall, unless the Court which issued the warrant is within thirty kilometres
of the place of arrest or is nearer than the Executive Magistrate or District Superintendent of
Police or Commissioner of Police within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the arrest was
made, or unless security is taken under section 73, be taken before such Magistrate or
District Superintendent or Commissioner.
(2) On the arrest of any person referred to in sub-section (1), the police officer shall
forthwith give the information regarding such arrest and the place where the arrested person
is being held to the designated police officer in the district and to such officer of another
district where the arrested person normally resides.
83. (1) The Executive Magistrate or District Superintendent of Police or Commissioner
of Police shall, if the person arrested appears to be the person intended by the Court which
issued the warrant, direct his removal in custody to such Court:
Provided that, if the offence is bailable, and such person is ready and willing to give
bail bond to the satisfaction of such Magistrate, District Superintendent or Commissioner,
or a direction has been endorsed under section 73 on the warrant and such person is ready
and willing to give the security required by such direction, the Magistrate, District
Superintendent or Commissioner shall take such bail bond or security, as the case may be,
and forward the bond, to the Court which issued the warrant:
Provided further that if the offence is a non-bailable one, it shall be lawful for the Chief
Judicial Magistrate (subject to the provisions of section 480), or the Sessions Judge, of the
district in which the arrest is made on consideration of the information and the documents
referred to in sub-section (2) of section 80, to release such person on bail.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent a police officer from taking
security under section 73.
C.
84. (1) If any Court has reason to believe (whether after taking evidence or not) that
any person against whom a warrant has been issued by it has absconded or is concealing
himself so that such warrant cannot be executed, such Court may publish a written
proclamation requiring him to appear at a specified place and at a specified time not less
than thirty days from the date of publishing such proclamation.
(2) The proclamation shall be published as follows: 
(i) (a) it shall be publicly read in some conspicuous place of the town or village
in which such person ordinarily resides;
(b) it shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the house or homestead in
which such person ordinarily resides or to some conspicuous place of such town or
village;
(c) a copy thereof shall be affixed to some conspicuous part of the
Court-house;
(ii) the Court may also, if it thinks fit, direct a copy of the proclamation to be
published in a daily newspaper circulating in the place in which such person ordinarily
resides.
(3) A statement in writing by the Court issuing the proclamation to the effect that the
proclamation was duly published on a specified day, in the manner specified in clause (i) of
sub-section (2), shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this section have
been complied with, and that the proclamation was published on such day.
(4) Where a proclamation published under sub-section (1) is in respect of a person
accused of an offence which is made punishable with imprisonment of ten years or more, or
imprisonment for life or with death under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 or under any
other law for the time being in force, and such person fails to appear at the specified place
and time required by the proclamation, the Court may, after making such inquiry as it thinks
fit, pronounce him a proclaimed offender and make a declaration to that effect.
(5) The provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3) shall apply to a declaration made
by the Court under sub-section (4) as they apply to the proclamation published under
sub-section (1).
85. (1) The Court issuing a proclamation under section 84 may, for reasons to be
recorded in writing, at any time after the issue of the proclamation, order the attachment of
any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to the proclaimed person:
Provided that where at the time of the issue of the proclamation the Court is satisfied,
by affidavit or otherwise, that the person in relation to whom the proclamation is to be
issued, 
(a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property; or
(b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local
jurisdiction of the Court,
it may order the attachment of property simultaneously with the issue of the proclamation.
(2) Such order shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such
person within the district in which it is made; and it shall authorise the attachment of any
property belonging to such person without such district when endorsed by the District
Magistrate within whose district such property is situate.
(3) If the property ordered to be attached is a debt or other movable property, the
attachment under this section shall be made 
(a) by seizure; or
(b) by the appointment of a receiver; or
(c) by an order in writing prohibiting the delivery of such property to the
proclaimed person or to any one on his behalf; or
(d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.
(4) If the property ordered to be attached is immovable, the attachment under this
section shall, in the case of land paying revenue to the State Government, be made through
the Collector of the district in which the land is situate, and in all other cases 
(a) by taking possession; or
(b) by the appointment of a receiver; or
(c) by an order in writing prohibiting the payment of rent on delivery of property
to the proclaimed person or to any one on his behalf; or
(d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.
(5) If the property ordered to be attached consists of live-stock or is of a perishable
nature, the Court may, if it thinks it expedient, order immediate sale thereof, and in such case
the proceeds of the sale shall abide the order of the Court.
(6) The powers, duties and liabilities of a receiver appointed under this section shall
be the same as those of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
86. The Court may, on the written request from a police officer not below the rank of
the Superintendent of Police or Commissioner of Police, initiate the process of requesting
assistance from a Court or an authority in the contracting State for identification, attachment
and forfeiture of property belonging to a proclaimed person in accordance with the procedure
provided in Chapter VIII.
87. (1) If any claim is preferred to, or objection made to the attachment of, any
property attached under section 85, within six months from the date of such attachment, by
any person other than the proclaimed person, on the ground that the claimant or objector
has an interest in such property, and that such interest is not liable to attachment under
section 85, the claim or objection shall be inquired into, and may be allowed or disallowed in
whole or in part:
Provided that any claim preferred or objection made within the period allowed by this
sub-section may, in the event of the death of the claimant or objector, be continued by his
legal representative.
(2) Claims or objections under sub-section (1) may be preferred or made in the Court
by which the order of attachment is issued, or, if the claim or objection is in respect of
property attached under an order endorsed under sub-section (2) of section 85, in the Court
of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of the district in which the attachment is made.
(3) Every such claim or objection shall be inquired into by the Court in which it is
preferred or made:
Provided that, if it is preferred or made in the Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate, he
may make it over for disposal to any Magistrate subordinate to him.
(4) Any person whose claim or objection has been disallowed in whole or in part by an
order under sub-section (1) may, within a period of one year from the date of such order,
institute a suit to establish the right which he claims in respect of the property in dispute;
but subject to the result of such suit, if any, the order shall be conclusive.
88. (1) If the proclaimed person appears within the time specified in the proclamation,
the Court shall make an order releasing the property from the attachment.
(2) If the proclaimed person does not appear within the time specified in the
proclamation, the property under the attachment shall be at the disposal of the State
Government; but it shall not be sold until the expiration of six months from the date of the
attachment and until any claim preferred or objection made under section 87 has been
disposed of under that section, unless it is subject to speedy and natural decay, or the
Court considers that the sale would be for the benefit of the owner; in either of which cases
the Court may cause it to be sold whenever it thinks fit.
(3) If, within two years from the date of the attachment, any person whose property is
or has been at the disposal of the State Government under sub-section (2), appears voluntarily
or is apprehended and brought before the Court by whose order the property was attached,
or the Court to which such Court is subordinate, and proves to the satisfaction of such
Court that he did not abscond or conceal himself for the purpose of avoiding execution of
the warrant, and that he had not such notice of the proclamation as to enable him to attend
within the time specified therein, such property, or, if the same has been sold, the net
proceeds of the sale, or, if part only thereof has been sold, the net proceeds of the sale and
the residue of the property, shall, after satisfying therefrom all costs incurred in consequence
of the attachment, be delivered to him.
89. Any person referred to in sub-section (3) of section 88, who is aggrieved by any
refusal to deliver property or the proceeds of the sale thereof may appeal to the Court to
which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentences of the first-mentioned Court.
D.
90. A Court may, in any case in which it is empowered by this Sanhita to issue a
summons for the appearance of any person, issue, after recording its reasons in writing, a
warrant for his arrest 
(a) if, either before the issue of such summons, or after the issue of the same but
before the time fixed for his appearance, the Court sees reason to believe that he has
absconded or will not obey the summons; or
(b) if at such time he fails to appear and the summons is proved to have been
duly served in time to admit of his appearing in accordance therewith and no reasonable
excuse is offered for such failure.
91. When any person for whose appearance or arrest the officer presiding in any
Court is empowered to issue a summons or warrant, is present in such Court, such officer
may require such person to execute a bond or bail bond for his appearance in such Court, or
any other Court to which the case may be transferred for trial.
92. When any person who is bound by any bond or bail bond taken under this

in connection with other facts, the existence, non-existence, nature or extent of any
right, liability or disability, asserted or denied in any suit or proceeding, necessarily
follows.
Explanation. Whenever, under the provisions of the law for the time being

of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant, and
of no others.
Explanation. This section shall not enable any person to give evidence of a fact
which he is disentitled to prove by any provision of the law for the time being in force
relating to civil procedure.
Illustrations.

A's causing B's death by such beating;
A's intention to cause B's death.
(b) A suitor does not bring with him, and have in readiness for production at the first
hearing of the case, a bond on which he relies. This section does not enable him to produce
the bond or prove its contents at a subsequent stage of the proceedings, otherwise than in
accordance with the conditions prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
4. Facts which, though not in issue, are so connected with a fact in issue or a
relevant fact as to form part of the same transaction, are relevant, whether they occurred at
the same time and place or at different times and places.
Illustrations.
(a) A is accused of the murder of B by beating him. Whatever was said or done by A
or B or the bystanders at the beating, or so shortly before or after it as to form part of the
transaction, is a relevant fact.
(b) A is accused of waging war against the Government of India by taking part in an
armed insurrection in which property is destroyed, troops are attacked and jails are broken
open. The occurrence of these facts is relevant, as forming part of the general transaction,
though A may not have been present at all of them.
(c) A sues B for a libel contained in a letter forming part of a correspondence. Letters
between the parties relating to the subject out of which the libel arose, and forming part of
the correspondence in which it is contained, are relevant facts, though they do not contain
the libel itself.
(d) The question is, whether certain goods ordered from B were delivered to A. The
goods were delivered to several intermediate persons successively. Each delivery is a
relevant fact.
5. Facts which are the occasion, cause or effect, immediate or otherwise, of relevant
facts, or facts in issue, or which constitute the state of things under which they happened,
or which afforded an opportunity for their occurrence or transaction, are relevant.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A robbed B. The facts that, shortly before the robbery,
B went to a fair with money in his possession, and that he showed it, or mentioned the fact
that he had it, to third persons, are relevant.

struggle at or near the place where the murder was committed, are relevant facts.
(c) The question is, whetherApoisoned B. The state of B's health before the symptoms
ascribed to poison, and habits of B, known to A, which afforded an opportunity for the
administration of poison, are relevant facts.
6. (1) Any fact is relevant which shows or constitutes a motive or preparation for any
fact in issue or relevant fact.
(2) The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any party, to any suit or proceeding,
in reference to such suit or proceeding, or in reference to any fact in issue therein or relevant
thereto, and the conduct of any person, an offence against whom is the subject of any
proceeding, is relevant, if such conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or
relevant fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent thereto.
Explanation 1. The word "conduct" in this section does not include statements,
unless those statements accompany and explain acts other than statements; but this
explanation is not to affect the relevancy of statements under any other section of this
Adhiniyam.
Explanation 2. When the conduct of any person is relevant, any statement made to
him or in his presence and hearing, which affects such conduct, is relevant.
Illustrations.
(a) Ais tried for the murder of B. The facts thatAmurdered C, that B knew thatAhad
murdered C, and that B had tried to extort money fromAby threatening to make his knowledge
public, are relevant.
(b) A sues B upon a bond for the payment of money. B denies the making of the
bond. The fact that, at the time when the bond was alleged to be made, B required money for
a particular purpose, is relevant.
(c) A is tried for the murder of B by poison. The fact that, before the death of B, A
procured poison similar to that which was administered to B, is relevant.
(d) The question is, whether a certain document is the will of A. The facts that, not
long before, the date of the alleged will,Amade inquiry into matters to which the provisions
of the alleged will relate; that he consulted advocates in reference to making the will, and
that he caused drafts of other wills to be prepared, of which he did not approve, are relevant.
(e) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, either before, or at the time of, or after the
alleged crime, A provided evidence which would tend to give to the facts of the case an
appearance favourable to himself, or that he destroyed or concealed evidence, or prevented
the presence or procured the absence of persons who might have been witnesses, or
suborned persons to give false evidence respecting it, are relevant.
(f) The question is, whetherArobbed B. The facts that, after B was robbed, C said in
A's presence "the police are coming to look for the person who robbed B", and that
immediately afterwardsAran away, are relevant.
(g) The question is, whether A owes B ten thousand rupees. The facts that A asked
C to lend him money, and that D said to C in A's presence and hearing "I advise you not
to trust A, for he owes B ten thousand rupees", and that A went away without making any
answer, are relevant facts.
(h) The question is, whether A committed a crime. The fact that A absconded, after
receiving a letter, warning A that inquiry was being made for the criminal, and the contents
of the letter, are relevant.
(i) A is accused of a crime. The facts that, after the commission of the alleged crime,
A absconded, or was in possession of property or the proceeds of property acquired by the
crime, or attempted to conceal things which were or might have been used in committing it,
are relevant.
(j) The question is, whetherAwas raped. The fact that, shortly after the alleged rape,
A made a complaint relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in
which, the complaint was made, are relevant. The fact that, without making a complaint, A
said that A had been raped is not relevant as conduct under this section, though it may be
relevant as a dying declaration under clause (a) of section 26, or as corroborative evidence
under section 160.
(k) The question is, whether A was robbed. The fact that, soon after the alleged
robbery,Amade a complaint relating to the offence, the circumstances under which, and the
terms in which, the complaint was made, are relevant. The fact that A said he had been
robbed, without making any complaint, is not relevant, as conduct under this section,
though it may be relevant as a dying declaration under clause (a) of section 26, or as
corroborative evidence under section 160.
7. Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which
support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or a relevant fact, or which
establish the identity of anything, or person whose identity, is relevant, or fix the time or
place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened, or which show the relation of
parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are relevant in so far as they are necessary
for that purpose.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether a given document is the will of A. The state of A's
property and of his family at the date of the alleged will may be relevant facts.
(b) A sues B for a libel imputing disgraceful conduct to A; B affirms that the matter
alleged to be libellous is true. The position and relations of the parties at the time when the
libel was published may be relevant facts as introductory to the facts in issue. The particulars
of a dispute betweenAand B about a matter unconnected with the alleged libel are irrelevant,
though the fact that there was a dispute may be relevant if it affected the relations between
A and B.
(c) A is accused of a crime. The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, A
absconded from his house, is relevant under section 6, as conduct subsequent to and
affected by facts in issue. The fact that, at the time when he left home, A had sudden and
urgent business at the place to which he went, is relevant, as tending to explain the fact that
he left home suddenly. The details of the business on which he left are not relevant, except
in so far as they are necessary to show that the business was sudden and urgent.
(d) A sues B for inducing C to break a contract of service made by him with A. C, on
leaving A's service, says to A "I am leaving you because B has made me a better offer".
This statement is a relevant fact as explanatory of C's conduct, which is relevant as a fact in
issue.
(e) A, accused of theft, is seen to give the stolen property to B, who is seen to give it
to A's wife. B says as he delivers it "A says you are to hide this". B's statement is relevant
as explanatory of a fact which is part of the transaction.
(f)Ais tried for a riot and is proved to have marched at the head of a mob. The cries of
the mob are relevant as explanatory of the nature of the transaction.
8. Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have
conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything said, done or
written by any one of such persons in reference to their common intention, after the time
when such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against
each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the
existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party
to it.
Illustration.
Reasonable ground exists for believing thatAhas joined in a conspiracy to wage war
against the State.
The facts that B procured arms in Europe for the purpose of the conspiracy, C collected
money in Kolkata for a like object, D persuaded persons to join the conspiracy in Mumbai,
E published writings advocating the object in view atAgra, and F transmitted from Delhi to
G at Singapore the money which C had collected at Kolkata, and the contents of a letter
written by H giving an account of the conspiracy, are each relevant, both to prove the
existence of the conspiracy, and to prove A's complicity in it, although he may have been
ignorant of all of them, and although the persons by whom they were done were strangers
to him, and although they may have taken place before he joined the conspiracy or after he
left it.
9. Facts not otherwise relevant are relevant 
(1) if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact;
(2) if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the existence or
non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact highly probable or improbable.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A committed a crime at Chennai on a certain day.
The fact that, on that day, A was at Ladakh is relevant. The fact that, near the time
when the crime was committed, A was at a distance from the place where it was
committed, which would render it highly improbable, though not impossible, that he
committed it, is relevant.
(b) The question is, whether A committed a crime. The circumstances are such
that the crime must have been committed either by A, B, C or D. Every fact which
shows that the crime could have been committed by no one else, and that it was not
committed by either B, C or D, is relevant.
10. In suits in which damages are claimed, any fact which will enable the Court to
determine the amount of damages which ought to be awarded, is relevant.
11. Where the question is as to the existence of any right or custom, the following
facts are relevant 
(a) any transaction by which the right or custom in question was created,
claimed, modified, recognised, asserted or denied, or which was inconsistent with its
existence;
(b) particular instances in which the right or custom was claimed, recognised
or exercised, or in which its exercise was disputed, asserted or departed from.
Illustration.
The question is, whether A has a right to a fishery. A deed conferring the fishery on
A's ancestors, a mortgage of the fishery by A's father, a subsequent grant of the fishery by
A's father, irreconcilable with the mortgage, particular instances in whichA's father exercised
the right, or in which the exercise of the right was stopped by A's neighbours, are relevant
facts.
12. Facts showing the existence of any state of mind, such as intention, knowledge,
good faith, negligence, rashness, ill-will or goodwill towards any particular person, or
showing the existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, are relevant, when the existence
of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue or relevant.
Explanation 1. A fact relevant as showing the existence of a relevant state of mind
must show that the state of mind exists, not generally, but in reference to the particular
matter in question.
Explanation 2. But where, upon the trial of a person accused of an offence, the
previous commission by the accused of an offence is relevant within the meaning of this
section, the previous conviction of such person shall also be a relevant fact.
Illustrations.
(a)Ais accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. It is proved that
he was in possession of a particular stolen article. The fact that, at the same time, he was in
possession of many other stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each
and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen.
(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency
which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. The fact that, at the time
of its delivery, A was possessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit currency is
relevant. The fact that A had been previously convicted of delivering to another person as
genuine a counterfeit currency knowing it to be counterfeit is relevant.
(c)Asues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be ferocious. The fact
that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are
relevant.
(d) The question is, whetherA, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name
of the payee was fictitious. The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same
manner before they could have been transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been
a real person, is relevant, as showing that A knew that the payee was a fictitious person.
(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the
reputation of B. The fact of previous publications byArespecting B, showing ill-will on the
part of A towards B is relevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the
particular publication in question. The facts that there was no previous quarrel between A
and B, and thatArepeated the matter complained of as he heard it, are relevant, as showing
that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B.
(f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby B,
being induced to trust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss. The fact that, at the time when
A represented C to be solvent, C was supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by
persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing that A made the representation in good
faith.
(g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is owner,
by the order of C, a contractor. A's defence is that B's contract was with C. The fact that A
paid C for the work in question is relevant, as proving thatAdid, in good faith, make over to
C the management of the work in question, so that C was in a position to contract with B on
C's own account, and not as agent for A.
(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found,
and the question is whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real
owner could not be found. The fact that public notice of the loss of the property had been
given in the place where A was, is relevant, as showing that A did not in good faith believe
that the real owner of the property could not be found. The fact that A knew, or had reason
to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had heard of the loss of the
property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A
knew of the notice did not disprove A's good faith.
(i)A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to show A's intent,
the fact of A's having previously shot at B may be proved.
(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously
sent by A to B may be proved, as showing the intention of the letters.
(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife.
Expressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are
relevant facts.
(l) The question is, whether A's death was caused by poison. Statements made by A
during his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts.
(m) The question is, what was the state ofA's health at the time when an assurance on
his life was effected. Statements made byAas to the state of his health at or near the time in
question are relevant facts.
(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a car for hire not reasonably fit for
use, wherebyAwas injured. The fact that B's attention was drawn on other occasions to the
defect of that particular car is relevant. The fact that B was habitually negligent about the
cars which he let to hire is irrelevant.
(o)Ais tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead.The fact thatAon
other occasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B. The fact that A
was in the habit of shooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant.
(p) A is tried for a crime. The fact that he said something indicating an intention to
commit that particular crime is relevant. The fact that he said something indicating a general
disposition to commit crimes of that class is irrelevant.
13. When there is a question whether an act was accidental or intentional, or done
with a particular knowledge or intention, the fact that such act formed part of a series of
similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was concerned, is relevant.
Illustrations.
(a) A is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for which it is
insured. The facts that A lived in several houses successively each of which he insured, in
each of which a fire occurred, and after each of which fires A received payment from a
different insurance company, are relevant, as tending to show that the fires were not
accidental.
(b)Ais employed to receive money from the debtors of B. It isA's duty to make entries
in a book showing the amounts received by him. He makes an entry showing that on a
particular occasion he received less than he really did receive. The question is, whether this
false entry was accidental or intentional. The facts that other entries made by A in the same
book are false, and that the false entry is in each case in favour of A, are relevant.
(c) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to B a counterfeit currency. The question
is, whether the delivery of the currency was accidental. The facts that, soon before or soon
after the delivery to B, A delivered counterfeit currency to C, D and E are relevant, as
showing that the delivery to B was not accidental.
14. When there is a question whether a particular act was done, the existence of any
course of business, according to which it naturally would have been done, is a relevant fact.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether a particular letter was dispatched. The facts that it was
the ordinary course of business for all letters put in a certain place to be carried to the post,
and that particular letter was put in that place are relevant.
(b) The question is, whether a particular letter reached A. The facts that it was posted
in due course, and was not returned through the Return Letter Office, are relevant.
15. An admission is a statement, oral or documentary or contained in electronic form,
which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by
any of the persons, and under the circumstances, hereinafter mentioned.
16. (1) Statements made by a party to the proceeding, or by an agent to any such
party, whom the Court regards, under the circumstances of the case, as expressly or impliedly
authorised by him to make them, are admissions.
(2) Statements made by 
(i) parties to suits suing or sued in a representative character, are not admissions,
unless they were made while the party making them held that character; or
(ii) (a) persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary interest in the subject
matter of the proceeding, and who make the statement in their character of persons so
interested; or
(b) persons from whom the parties to the suit have derived their interest in the
subject matter of the suit,
are admissions, if they are made during the continuance of the interest of the persons
making the statements.
17. Statements made by persons whose position or liability, it is necessary to prove
as against any party to the suit, are admissions, if such statements would be relevant as
against such persons in relation to such position or liability in a suit brought by or against
them, and if they are made whilst the person making them occupies such position or is
subject to such liability.
Illustration.
Aundertakes to collect rents for B. B suesAfor not collecting rent due from C to B.A
denies that rent was due from C to B.Astatement by C that he owed B rent is an admission,
and is a relevant fact as against A, if A denies that C did owe rent to B.
18. Statements made by persons to whom a party to the suit has expressly referred
for information in reference to a matter in dispute are admissions.
Illustration.
The question is, whether a horse sold by A to B is sound.
A says to B "Go and ask C, C knows all about it". C's statement is an admission.
19. Admissions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes
them, or his representative in interest; but they cannot be proved by or on behalf of the
person who makes them or by his representative in interest, except in the following cases,
namely: 
(1) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when
it is of such a nature that, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as
between third persons under section 26;
(2) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when
it consists of a statement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant or in
issue, made at or about the time when such state of mind or body existed, and is
accompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood improbable;
(3) an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, if it is
relevant otherwise than as an admission.
Illustrations.
(a) The question between A and B is, whether a certain deed is or is not forged. A
affirms that it is genuine, B that it is forged. A may prove a statement by B that the deed is
genuine, and B may prove a statement by A that deed is forged; but A cannot prove a
statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a statement by himself that
the deed is forged.
(b) A, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away. Evidence is given to show
that the ship was taken out of her proper course. A produces a book kept by him in the
ordinary course of his business showing observations alleged to have been taken by him
from day to day, and indicating that the ship was not taken out of her proper course. A may
prove these statements, because they would be admissible between third parties, if he were
dead, under clause (b) of section 26.
(c)Ais accused of a crime committed by him at Kolkata. He produces a letter written
by himself and dated at Chennai on that day, and bearing the Chennai post-mark of that day.
The statement in the date of the letter is admissible, because, if A were dead, it would be
admissible under clause (b) of section 26.
(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He offers to
prove that he refused to sell them below their value.A may prove these statements, though
they are admissions, because they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue.
(e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit currency which
he knew to be counterfeit. He offers to prove that he asked a skilful person to examine the
currency as he doubted whether it was counterfeit or not, and that person did examine it
and told him it was genuine. A may prove these facts.
20. Oral admissions as to the contents of a document are not relevant, unless and
until the party proposing to prove them shows that he is entitled to give secondary evidence
of the contents of such document under the rules hereinafter contained, or unless the
genuineness of a document produced is in question.
21. In civil cases no admission is relevant, if it is made either upon an express condition
that evidence of it is not to be given, or under circumstances from which the Court can infer
that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.
Explanation. Nothing in this section shall be taken to exempt any advocate from
giving evidence of any matter of which he may be compelled to give evidence under
sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 132.
22. A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if
the making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement,
threat, coercion or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person,
proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give the
accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by
making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to
the proceedings against him:
Provided that if the confession is made after the impression caused by any such
inducement, threat, coercion or promise has, in the opinion of the Court, been fully removed,
it is relevant:
Provided further that if such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not become
irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a
deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was
drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered,
whatever may have been the form of those questions, or because he was not warned that he
was not bound to make such confession, and that evidence of it might be given against him.
23. (1) No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person
accused of any offence.
(2) No confession made by any person while he is in the custody of a police officer,
unless it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate shall be proved against him:
Provided that when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information
received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much
of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the
fact discovered, may be proved.
24. When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a
confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons
is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other
person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
Explanation I. "Offence", as used in this section, includes the abetment of, or
attempt to commit, the offence.
Explanation II. A trial of more persons than one held in the absence of the accused
who has absconded or who fails to comply with a proclamation issued under section 84 of
the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 shall be deemed to be a joint trial for the
purpose of this section.
Illustrations.
(a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that A said "B and I
murdered C". The Court may consider the effect of this confession as against B.
(b)Ais on his trial for the murder of C. There is evidence to show that C was murdered
by A and B, and that B said "A and I murdered C". This statement may not be taken into
consideration by the Court against A, as B is not being jointly tried.
25. Admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters admitted but they may operate
as estoppels under the provisions hereinafter contained.
26. Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or
who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance
cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances
of the case appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following
cases, namely: 
(a) when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as
to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in
which the cause of that person's death comes into question. Such statements are
relevant whether the person who made them was or was not, at the time when they
were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the
proceeding in which the cause of his death comes into question;
(b) when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of
business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made by him
in books kept in the ordinary course of business, or in the discharge of professional
duty; or of an acknowledgement written or signed by him of the receipt of money,
goods, securities or property of any kind; or of a document used in commerce written
or signed by him; or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written or
signed by him;
(c) when the statement is against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the
person making it, or when, if true, it would expose him or would have exposed him to
a criminal prosecution or to a suit for damages;
(d) when the statement gives the opinion of any such person, as to the existence
of any public right or custom or matter of public or general interest, of the existence of
which, if it existed, he would have been likely to be aware, and when such statement
was made before any controversy as to such right, custom or matter had arisen;
(e) when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood,
marriage or adoption between persons as to whose relationship by blood, marriage or
adoption the person making the statement had special means of knowledge, and
when the statement was made before the question in dispute was raised;
(f) when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood,
marriage or adoption between persons deceased, and is made in any will or deed
relating to the affairs of the family to which any such deceased person belonged, or in
any family pedigree, or upon any tombstone, family portrait or other thing on which
such statements are usually made, and when such statement was made before the
question in dispute was raised;
(g) when the statement is contained in any deed, will or other document which
relates to any such transaction as is specified in clause (a) of section 11;
(h) when the statement was made by a number of persons, and expressed
feelings or impressions on their part relevant to the matter in question.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A was murdered by B; or A dies of injuries received in a
transaction in the course of which she was raped. The question is whether she was raped
by B; or the question is, whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit
would lie against B byA's widow. Statements made by A as to the cause of his or her death,
referring respectively to the murder, the rape and the actionable wrong under consideration,
are relevant facts.
(b) The question is as to the date of A's birth. An entry in the diary of a deceased
surgeon regularly kept in the course of business, stating that, on a given day he attended
A's mother and delivered her of a son, is a relevant fact.
(c) The question is, whether Awas in Nagpur on a given day. Astatement in the diary
of a deceased solicitor, regularly kept in the course of business, that on a given day the
solicitor attendedAat a place mentioned, in Nagpur, for the purpose of conferring with him
upon specified business, is a relevant fact.
(d) The question is, whether a ship sailed from Mumbai harbour on a given day. A
letter written by a deceased member of a merchant's firm by which she was chartered to their
correspondents in Chennai, to whom the cargo was consigned, stating that the ship sailed
on a given day from Mumbai port, is a relevant fact.
(e) The question is, whether rent was paid to A for certain land. A letter from A's
deceased agent to A, saying that he had received the rent on A's account and held it at A's
orders is a relevant fact.

(n) A sues B for a libel expressed in a painted caricature exposed in a shop window.
The question is as to the similarity of the caricature and its libellous character. The remarks
of a crowd of spectators on these points may be proved.
27. Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person
authorised by law to take it, is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial
proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which
it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence,
or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without
an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court
considers unreasonable:
Provided that the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives in
interest; that the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to
cross-examine and the questions in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the
second proceeding.
Explanation. A criminal trial or inquiry shall be deemed to be a proceeding between
the prosecutor and the accused within the meaning of this section.
28. Entries in the books of account, including those maintained in an electronic form,
regularly kept in the course of business are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into
which the Court has to inquire, but such statements shall not alone be sufficient evidence
to charge any person with liability.
Illustration.
A sues B for one thousand rupees, and shows entries in his account books showing
B to be indebted to him to this amount. The entries are relevant, but are not sufficient,
without other evidence, to prove the debt.
29. An entry in any public or other official book, register or record or an electronic
record, stating a fact in issue or relevant fact, and made by a public servant in the discharge
of his official duty, or by any other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by
the law of the country in which such book, register or record or an electronic record, is kept,
is itself a relevant fact.
30. Statements of facts in issue or relevant facts, made in published maps or charts
generally offered for public sale, or in maps or plans made under the authority of the Central
Government or any State Government, as to matters usually represented or stated in such
maps, charts or plans, are themselves relevant facts.
31. When the Court has to form an opinion as to the existence of any fact of a public
nature, any statement of it, made in a recital contained in any Central Act or State Act or in
a Central Government or State Government notification appearing in the respective Official
Gazette or in any printed paper or in electronic or digital form purporting to be such Gazette,
is a relevant fact.
32. When the Court has to form an opinion as to a law of any country, any statement
of such law contained in a book purporting to be printed or published including in electronic
or digital form under the authority of the Government of such country and to contain any
such law, and any report of a ruling of the Courts of such country contained in a book
including in electronic or digital form purporting to be a report of such rulings, is relevant.
33. When any statement of which evidence is given forms part of a longer statement,
or of a conversation or part of an isolated document, or is contained in a document which
forms part of a book, or is contained in part of electronic record or of a connected series of
letters or papers, evidence shall be given of so much and no more of the statement,
conversation, document, electronic record, book or series of letters or papers as the Court
considers necessary in that particular case to the full understanding of the nature and effect
of the statement, and of the circumstances under which it was made.
34. The existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any Court
from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial, is a relevant fact when the question is
whether such Court ought to take cognizance of such suit or to hold such trial.
35. (1) A final judgment, order or decree of a competent Court or Tribunal, in the
exercise of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or insolvency jurisdiction, which confers upon
or takes away from any person any legal character, or which declares any person to be
entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to any specific thing, not as against any
specified person but absolutely, is relevant when the existence of any such legal character,
or the title of any such person to any such thing, is relevant.
(2) Such judgment, order or decree is conclusive proof that 
(i) any legal character, which it confers accrued at the time when such judgment,
order or decree came into operation;
(ii) any legal character, to which it declares any such person to be entitled,
accrued to that person at the time when such judgment, order or decree declares it to
have accrued to that person;
(iii) any legal character which it takes away from any such person ceased at the
time from which such judgment, order or decree declared that it had ceased or should
cease; and
(iv) anything to which it declares any person to be so entitled was the property
of that person at the time from which such judgment, order or decree declares that it
had been or should be his property.
36. Judgments, orders or decrees other than those mentioned in section 35 are relevant
if they relate to matters of a public nature relevant to the enquiry; but such judgments,
orders or decrees are not conclusive proof of that which they state.
Illustration.
A sues B for trespass on his land. B alleges the existence of a public right of way over
the land, which A denies. The existence of a decree in favour of the defendant, in a suit by
A against C for a trespass on the same land, in which C alleged the existence of the same
right of way, is relevant, but it is not conclusive proof that the right of way exists.
37. Judgments or orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in sections 34, 35
and 36, are irrelevant, unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in
issue, or is relevant under some other provision of this Adhiniyam.
Illustrations.
(a) A and B separately sue C for a libel which reflects upon each of them. C in each
case says that the matter alleged to be libellous is true, and the circumstances are such that
it is probably true in each case, or in neither.Aobtains a decree against C for damages on the
ground that C failed to make out his justification. The fact is irrelevant as between B and C.
(b) A prosecutes B for stealing a cow from him. B is convicted. A afterwards sues C
for the cow, which B had sold to him before his conviction. As between A and C, the
judgment against B is irrelevant.
(c) A has obtained a decree for the possession of land against B. C, B's son, murders
A in consequence. The existence of the judgment is relevant, as showing motive for a crime.
(d) A is charged with theft and with having been previously convicted of theft. The
previous conviction is relevant as a fact in issue.
(e) Ais tried for the murder of B. The fact that B prosecutedAfor libel and thatAwas
convicted and sentenced is relevant under section 6 as showing the motive for the fact in
issue.
38. Any party to a suit or other proceeding may show that any judgment, order or
decree which is relevant under section 34, 35 or 36, and which has been proved by the
adverse party, was delivered by a Court not competent to deliver it, or was obtained by
fraud or collusion.
39. (1) When the Court has to form an opinion upon a point of foreign law or of
science or art, or any other field, or as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions, the
opinions upon that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign law, science or art, or
any other field, or in questions as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions are
relevant facts and such persons are called experts.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether the death of A was caused by poison. The opinions of
experts as to the symptoms produced by the poison by which A is supposed to have died,
are relevant.
(b) The question is, whether A, at the time of doing a certain act, was, by reason of
unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he was doing what
was either wrong or contrary to law. The opinions of experts upon the question whether the
symptoms exhibited by A commonly show unsoundness of mind, and whether such
unsoundness of mind usually renders persons incapable of knowing the nature of the acts
which they do, or of knowing that what they do is either wrong or contrary to law, are
relevant.
(c) The question is, whether a certain document was written byA.Another document
is produced which is proved or admitted to have been written byA. The opinions of experts
on the question whether the two documents were written by the same person or by different
persons, are relevant.
(2) When in a proceeding, the court has to form an opinion on any matter relating to
any information transmitted or stored in any computer resource or any other electronic or
digital form, the opinion of the Examiner of Electronic Evidence referred to in section 79A of
the Information Technology Act, 2000, is a relevant fact.
Explanation. For the purposes of this sub-section, an Examiner of Electronic Evidence
shall be an expert.
40. Facts, not otherwise relevant, are relevant if they support or are inconsistent
with the opinions of experts, when such opinions are relevant.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A was poisoned by a certain poison. The fact that other
persons, who were poisoned by that poison, exhibited certain symptoms which experts
affirm or deny to be the symptoms of that poison, is relevant.
(b) The question is, whether an obstruction to a harbour is caused by a certain
sea-wall. The fact that other harbours similarly situated in other respects, but where there
were no such sea-walls, began to be obstructed at about the same time, is relevant.
41. (1) When the Court has to form an opinion as to the person by whom any document
was written or signed, the opinion of any person acquainted with the handwriting of the
person by whom it is supposed to be written or signed that it was or was not written or
signed by that person, is a relevant fact.
Explanation. A person is said to be acquainted with the handwriting of another
person when he has seen that person write, or when he has received documents purporting
to be written by that person in answer to documents written by himself or under his authority
and addressed to that person, or when, in the ordinary course of business, documents
purporting to be written by that person have been habitually submitted to him.
Illustration.
The question is, whether a given letter is in the handwriting of A, a merchant in
Itanagar. B is a merchant in Bengaluru, who has written letters addressed toAand received
letters purporting to be written by him. C, is B's clerk whose duty it was to examine and file
B's correspondence. D is B's broker, to whom B habitually submitted the letters purporting
to be written by A for the purpose of advising him thereon. The opinions of B, C and D on
the question whether the letter is in the handwriting of A are relevant, though neither B, C
nor D ever sawAwrite.
(2) When the Court has to form an opinion as to the electronic signature of any
person, the opinion of the Certifying Authority which has issued the Electronic Signature
Certificate is a relevant fact.
42. When the Court has to form an opinion as to the existence of any general custom
or right, the opinions, as to the existence of such custom or right, of persons who would be
likely to know of its existence if it existed, are relevant.
Explanation. The expression "general custom or right" includes customs or rights
common to any considerable class of persons.
Illustration.
The right of the villagers of a particular village to use the water of a particular well is
a general right within the meaning of this section.
43. When the Court has to form an opinion as to 
(i) the usages and tenets of any body of men or family;
(ii) the constitution and governance of any religious or charitable
foundation; or
(iii) the meaning of words or terms used in particular districts or by particular
classes of people,
the opinions of persons having special means of knowledge thereon, are relevant facts.
44. When the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to
another, the opinion, expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such relationship, of any
person who, as a member of the family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the
subject, is a relevant fact:
Provided that such opinion shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage in proceedings
under the Divorce Act, 1869, or in prosecution under sections 82 and 84 of the Bharatiya
Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.
Illustrations.
(a) The question is, whether A and B were married. The fact that they were usually
received and treated by their friends as husband and wife, is relevant.
(b) The question is, whetherAwas the legitimate son of B. The fact thatAwas always
treated as such by members of the family, is relevant.
45. Whenever the opinion of any living person is relevant, the grounds on which
such opinion is based are also relevant.
Illustration.
An expert may give an account of experiments performed by him for the purpose of
forming his opinion.
46. In civil cases the fact that the character of any person concerned is such as to
render probable or improbable any conduct imputed to him, is irrelevant, except in so far as
such character appears from facts otherwise relevant.
47. In criminal proceedings the fact that the person accused is of a good character, is
relevant.
48. In a prosecution for an offence under section 64, section 65, section 66,
section 67, section 68, section 69, section 70, section 71, section 74, section 75, section 76,
section 77 or section 78 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 or for attempt to commit any
such offence, where the question of consent is in issue, evidence of the character of the
victim or of such person's previous sexual experience with any person shall not be relevant
on the issue of such consent or the quality of consent.
49. In criminal proceedings, the fact that the accused has a bad character, is irrelevant,
unless evidence has been given that he has a good character, in which case it becomes
relevant.
Explanation 1. This section does not apply to cases in which the bad character of
any person is itself a fact in issue.
Explanation 2. A previous conviction is relevant as evidence of bad character.
50. In civil cases, the fact that the character of any person is such as to affect the
amount of damages which he ought to receive, is relevant.
Explanation. In this section and sections 46, 47 and 49, the word "character"
includes both reputation and disposition; but, except as provided in section 49, evidence
may be given only of general reputation and general disposition, and not of particular acts
by which reputation or disposition has been shown.
51. No fact of which the Court will take judicial notice need be proved.
52. (1) The Court shall take judicial notice of the following facts, namely: 
(a) all laws in force in the territory of India including laws having extra-territorial

of reference and if the Court is called upon by any person to take judicial notice of any fact,
it may refuse to do so unless and until such person produces any such book or document
as it may consider necessary to enable it to do so.
53. No fact needs to be proved in any proceeding which the parties thereto or their
agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which, before the hearing, they agree to admit by
any writing under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are
deemed to have admitted by their pleadings:
Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved
otherwise than by such admissions.
54. All facts, except the contents of documents may be proved by oral evidence.
55. Oral evidence shall, in all cases whatever, be direct; if it refers to, 
(i) a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he
saw it;
(ii) a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a witness who says
he heard it;
(iii) a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other manner,
it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived it by that sense or in that
manner;
(iv) an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the
evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds:
Provided that the opinions of experts expressed in any treatise commonly offered for
sale, and the grounds on which such opinions are held, may be proved by the production
of such treatises if the author is dead or cannot be found, or has become incapable of giving
evidence, or cannot be called as a witness without an amount of delay or expense which the
Court regards as unreasonable:
Provided further that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any
material thing other than a document, the Court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of
such material thing for its inspection.
56. The contents of documents may be proved either by primary or by secondary
evidence.
57. Primary evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of the
Court.
Explanation 1. Where a document is executed in several parts, each part is primary
evidence of the document.
Explanation 2. Where a document is executed in counterpart, each counterpart
being executed by one or some of the parties only, each counterpart is primary evidence as
against the parties executing it.
Explanation 3. Where a number of documents are all made by one uniform process,
as in the case of printing, lithography or photography, each is primary evidence of the
contents of the rest; but, where they are all copies of a common original, they are not
primary evidence of the contents of the original.
Explanation 4. Where an electronic or digital record is created or stored, and such
storage occurs simultaneously or sequentially in multiple files, each such file is primary
evidence.
Explanation 5. Where an electronic or digital record is produced from proper
custody, such electronic and digital record is primary evidence unless it is disputed.
Explanation 6. Where a video recording is simultaneously stored in electronic
form and transmitted or broadcast or transferred to another, each of the stored recordings is
primary evidence.
Explanation 7. Where an electronic or digital record is stored in multiple storage
spaces in a computer resource, each such automated storage, including temporary files, is
primary evidence.
Illustration.
A person is shown to have been in possession of a number of placards, all printed at
one time from one original. Any one of the placards is primary evidence of the contents of
any other, but no one of them is primary evidence of the contents of the original.
58. Secondary evidence includes 
(i) certified copies given under the provisions hereinafter contained;
(ii) copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves
ensure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies;
(iii) copies made from or compared with the original;
(iv) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute
them;
(v) oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has
himself seen it;
(vi) oral admissions;
(vii) written admissions;
(viii) evidence of a person who has examined a document, the original of which
consists of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be
examined in Court, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents.
Illustrations.
(a) A photograph of an original is secondary evidence of its contents, though the
two have not been compared, if it is proved that the thing photographed was the original.
(b) A copy compared with a copy of a letter made by a copying machine is secondary
evidence of the contents of the letter, if it is shown that the copy made by the copying
machine was made from the original.
(c) A copy transcribed from a copy, but afterwards compared with the original, is
secondary evidence; but the copy not so compared is not secondary evidence of the
original, although the copy from which it was transcribed was compared with the original.
(d) Neither an oral account of a copy compared with the original, nor an oral account
of a photograph or machine-copy of the original, is secondary evidence of the original.
59. Documents shall be proved by primary evidence except in the cases hereinafter
mentioned.
60. Secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition, or contents of a
document in the following cases, namely:  
(a) when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power 
(i) of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved; or
(ii) of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the
Court; or
(iii) of any person legally bound to produce it,
and when, after the notice mentioned in section 64 such person does not produce it;
(b) when the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved
to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his
representative in interest;
(c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering
evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default
or neglect, produce it in reasonable time;
(d) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable;
(e) when the original is a public document within the meaning of section 74;
(f) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this
Adhiniyam, or by any other law in force in India to be given in evidence;
(g) when the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents which
cannot conveniently be examined in Court, and the fact to be proved is the general
result of the whole collection.
Explanation. For the purposes of 
(i) clauses (a), (c) and (d), any secondary evidence of the contents of the
document is admissible;
(ii) clause (b), the written admission is admissible;
(iii) clause (e) or (f), a certified copy of the document, but no other kind of
secondary evidence, is admissible;
